# 2024-08-11 - Tech Pod Update: Matrix, Element, GitHub


## Why switch? 
Problems with current system: 

- Single stream conversation in Signal don't scale to large groups
- Signal chat per Pod hard to manage


We need: 

- Multi-stream communication 
  - Allows compartmentalized conversations
  - Allows cascading access rules for better privacy control
    - Randos: Everyone
    - JP4P Group Members: Folks who fill out crytpad and agree to Community statement
    - JP4P Pod Membership: Folks who join Pod-specific rooms
    - ...etc for Pod Leads, Space/Pod moderators, etc

## Future Discussion: 
- Github Organization
- GH-based Project plannning
- Moderation team
- Org/Pod organzation and plans
