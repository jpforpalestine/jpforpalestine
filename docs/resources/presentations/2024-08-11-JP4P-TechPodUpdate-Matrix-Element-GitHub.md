## [Matrix/Element Onboarding Instructions](/docs/onboarding/how-to-access-jp4p-matrix-element-space.md)


## Why switch? 
- Single Stream Communication is the devil
  - Its like shouting in a crowded room
  - Log-jam and overwhelm
  
- Multi-stream communication 
  - Allows compartmentalized conversations
  - Allows cascading access rules for better privacy control
    - Randos: Everyone
    - JP4P Group Members: Folks who fill out crytpad and agree to Community statement
    - JP4P Pod Membership: Folks who join Pod-specific rooms
    - ...etc for Pod Leads, Space/Pod moderators, etc
