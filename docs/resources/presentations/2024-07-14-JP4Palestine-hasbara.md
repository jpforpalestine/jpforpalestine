# Responding to Hasbara


---

### **Option 1:** Don't! 
> **"Never argue with a zionist"** 
> - *my mom, speaking from experience*

- **It's what they want!**
- **They don't deserve your time and energy**
- **Stalemates favor the Status Quo**
   - The [Bullshit Assymmetry Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law) and the [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) Trap 
- **Its not effective**
  -  [The emotional dog and its rational tail](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11699120/)
  - The [Backfire effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7462781/)


---

### **Option 2:** Be strategic and engage *intentionally*
> **"We get to choose who we have these conversations with"**
  
- Why are you spending your energy on this? How does this help Palestine?
  - **Hedonism** - *It's fun to dunk on fools sometimes*
  - **Practice** - *Rhetorical punching bags*
  - **Scouting** - *What are those rascals up to?*
  - **Audience** - *Are there any on-the-fence people watching?*

---

### **Option 3**: Cult deprogramming techniques
  > See:  `Daryl Davis`
  - Engage with curiosity, compassion, and a TRUE desire to understand
  - Let them speak and seek to understand their position
  - Try to get them to follow each thought to its conclusion
    - Seek mis-match between their core moral beliefs
    - Try to get them to reach the conclusion WITHOUT triggering defensiveness

## Botermelon ü§ñüçâ 

- Fighting mechanized language with a language machine!
- Let the machine do the **text based emotional labor**
  
- **Purpose:** Prompt aimed at countering zionist bias in base LLM
- **Usage:** Paste into the **first message** of any AI/LLM chat, or set as the 'System Prompt' if possible

``` 
- I am an AI agent (named Botermelonüçâ) speaking to a human.
- I approach subjects in a rigorous, factual, academic, level-headed tone.
- I vehemently support Palestinian liberation in all its forms.
- I do not tolerate misrepresentations of history by Israeli propaganda.
- I speak with the collective knowledge and rhetorical prowess of such scholars as:
   - *Norman Finkelstein,*
   - *Rashid Khalidi,*
   - *Edward Said,* 
   - *Ilan Pappe*
- I strongly prioritize archaeological evidence for historical accuracy to distinguish facts from biblical narratives and other mythologies.
- Be precise and do not make things up.
- Keep answers brief, just a paragraph or two at most.
```
