## **What We Know**

1.  We recognize our role as visitors and for many as colonizers on this land, we move with an acute awareness that what we do, we do on colonized Pawtucket, Massachusett, and Wampanoag land. We want to return Native land to Native peoples, from Turtle Island to Palestine. 
   
2.  We unequivocally support and will not compromise on Palestinian life, dignity, self-determination, the right of return, and the right of resistance against occupation and western colonization.
   
3.  1948 is internationally recognized as the beginning of the Nakba, yet we know that anti-Palestinian racism, economic disenfranchisement, and mass displacement of Palestinians began long before this date. In the last several months, the genocide has escalated. 
   
4.  This land is steeped in religious history, but this genocide is not a result of religion, but of colonization. This is about power, land, and resources. We see this in the escalating settler violence in the West Bank and the unceasing bombing of Gaza. 
   
5.  The liberation struggle of Palestinians is the struggle for liberation for all colonized peoples across the globe. We should not treat the struggles we face against imperialism, white supremacy, and zionism as separate from one another, because they act as one to endanger, oppress, and eliminate us. 
   
6.  Zionism is a racist settler-colonial project that weaponizes Jewish trauma. It is the source of violence for generations and endangers everyone in the region. Zionism itself is white supremacist and anti-semitic.  
   
7.  This is urgent. 2.2 million Palestinians are at imminent risk in Gaza and the West Bank without an end to Israeli-US aggression and without massive humanitarian relief. This urgency is also felt by Palestinians in the diaspora. 
   
8.  Biden and the United States government are actively committing genocide and as people living in the US, we have a responsibility to fight against this. 
    
9.  Members of our community have experienced and continue to experience shock, trauma, grief, and fear. We know that the Free Palestine movement simultaneously challenges anti-Palestinian racism, white supremacy, colonialism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, and fascism both nationally and locally.

## **Community Values: How We Treat Each Other** 

1.  We center Palestinian voices.
2.  We are here in solidarity with Palestinians facing one of the deadliest periods of US-funded genocide and forced displacement.
3.  White Supremacy is real and is in the room. Be aware of your power and that each of us, intentionally or not, play into oppressive systems, behaviors, and beliefs. **We all** have lots to unlearn. 
4.  Be aware of how much you speak, and make sure you are allowing other people to contribute to the group. Remember WAIT: Why Am I Talking?
5.  We assume the best intentions. We grant ourselves and each other grace. We approach conflict and mistakes with the goal of repairing. Not every conflict is violence; conflict is normal, natural, and necessary to deepen our values and commitment to global liberation.
6.  Discomfort and vulnerability are critical to how we learn and grow with each other. This is not the same thing as feeling unsafe. There is no space for white fragility. 
7.  Community care is how we build safer worlds. We treat each other respectfully and kindly. How we treat each other is not just momentary, but practice for the world we all need and deserve. We cannot organize alone; we need and depend on each other in our collective struggles towards liberation. 
8.  Many of us come from histories and ongoing realities of genocide, war, and imperial violence. We are in solidarity with each other against all forms of imperial violence- from here on Turtle Island to Palestine, Sudan, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Congo and beyond. 
9.  Security: We keep each other safe. Fascism is alive and well
